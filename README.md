To use this study guide there are notes on specific topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. If you aren't sure what to study first, you can open the DevTools by right-clicking on the webpage and clicking on "inspect" at the bottom of the popup window. From there, a window should open up and show a list of all the topics that we learned from the prework modules, along with a suggestion on what to study first!
